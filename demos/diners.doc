These programs may be freely copied, distributed, and modified 
for educational purposes but not for profit. If you modify or enhance 
the program (for example, to use other display systems), please send
me a copy of the modified code, either on diskette or by e-mail.

This system is an elaborate implementation of Edsger Dijkstra's
famous Dining Philosophers, a classical demonstration of deadlock
problems in concurrent programming.

This distribution consists of four files in addition to the one you
are reading.

File 2 is the line-by-line version of Diners, with all the compilation
units concatenated into a single ASCII file, using Richard Conn's
Pager2 program (see below). All the units are in the correct compilation
order, so a single command to your Ada compiler will compile the system
correctly. You need only to compile it, link the main program (diners),
and enjoy the action.

The following units are included in this file:

 io_libs.ada -- 10 Lines
 random.ads -- 17 Lines
 chop.ads -- 8 Lines
 phil.ads -- 14 Lines
 room.ads -- 17 Lines
 diners.ada -- 9 Lines
 random.adb -- 67 Lines
 chop.adb -- 18 Lines
 phil.adb -- 50 Lines
 roomline.adb -- 84 Lines

File 3 contains the necessary units to build the simple window version of
Diners. Compile it, re-link the main program, and have fun watching it.
The file contains the following units:

 screen.ads -- 15 Lines
 windows.ads -- 75 Lines
 screen.adb -- 30 Lines
 windows.adb -- 201 Lines
 roomwind.adb -- 102 Lines

File 4 contains the Ada sources for Richard Conn's Pager2 system, which
was used to collect the Ada units from the Diners system. You can compile
and link this too, if you wish, to form a general-purpose pager program.
The file contains:

 cli.ads -- 77 Lines
 cli.adb -- 219 Lines
 pager2.ada -- 1289 Lines

File 5 contains the documentation for Pager2; it's a straight ASCII file.

If you wish to modify any of the compilation units, you can separate
them with an editor, or un-page them using Pager2.

The Ada units follow the following naming convention:

.ADS files are package specifications
.ADB files are package bodies
.ADA files are main procedures or I/O instantiations

The packages Screen, Windows, and Random are reusable packages, and
existed before this project was undertaken.

The simple terminal package Screen gives a few screen-handling commands.
To run the windowing version on an MS-DOS machine, be sure that the
ANSI.SYS driver is given in your CONFIG.SYS. For machines like IBM
mainframes and Macintosh microcomputers, you will need to use the line-
oriented version, as these computers do not usually have ANSI 
terminal drivers. 

This program has been compiled and executed successfully under more than 
30 representatives of most of the major Ada compiler families, including
those from Alsys, DEC, Irvine, Meridian, Rational, RR, TeleSoft, and
Verdix, on machines from the Apple Macintosh and MS-DOS families to
IBM and Cray mainframes, and most major workstation families. Diners
has also been tested using the freely-available AdaEd system from New 
York University under DOS and Ultrix.

Please let me know of any tests (successful or not) with other compilers.
I believe that this program is a very useful demonstration of the
portability of Ada packages and tasking, and would like to know of
evidence confirming or refuting this belief! Enjoy!
