# This is a shell script version of the program which transforms a
#  .vbs file into a .h file.  It simply strips away blocks of commentary
#  from a verbose version of a header file. It reads from standard
#  input and writes to standard out.
#
# The definition of a block comment is simple-minded and wrong - it
#  could be dangerous to use this script on sources that aren't
#  written with it in mind.  The sed script simply removes all lines
#  between a line that opens a comment after only white space, and
#  the line containing the matching close of the comment. The
#  first sed line takes care of the case where the comment is on one
#  line.

sed -e '
  /^[ 	]*\/\*.*\*\// d
  /^[ 	]*\/\*/,/\*\// d'
